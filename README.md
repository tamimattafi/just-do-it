#  Just do it!
A todo-list app that makes it a breeze to plan tasks and keep them in mind!

This project was created in order to solve a knowledge test. 
It was also a chance to learn new technologies and architectures, so some concepts like Jetpack Compose and MVI were learned to be used here for the first time.


## Test requirements
- Build an Android app written in Kotlin which uses REST API (https://gorest.co.in/public-api/todos) to download a list of todos and show them in a list.  
- Todos should be saved in local storage so users could read them with no network connection. 
- The items on the list should display titles of todos. 
- Tapping an item on the list should display a details screen with the title of the corresponding item and date when todo was updated. This doesnâ€™t need to look beautiful in terms of UI.
- At least some components should be unit tested. 
- Focus on the scalable modular architecture.  
- We are interested in your skills and knowledge using databases, so database solution is what we expect.
